#### Thank you to

> the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things ... who have carried us up the long, rugged path toward prosperity and freedom.<br>
> -- Barack Obama, Inaugural Address, 2009

We would not have productions to review without the "makers of things". Thanks to all the companies, and the many, many people within them, who make the products we recommend. It would be a less prosperous and free world without your efforts.

#### Finally,

Thanks to those who share their opinions online (yes, really).

A review, a blog post, a comment. Obsessing over the details of a rumor for a product yet to be revealed...

It all contributes to the river of information that lets us find and select products to review.

Stay weird, Internet.
